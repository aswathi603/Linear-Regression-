Simple Linear Regression 📈
Simple linear regression models the relationship between two variables: an independent variable X and a dependent variable Y. It assumes a linear relationship between them:

Y=β 0 + β 1 ⋅X+ϵ
🔍 Objective Predict Y based on X.


🔑 Key Concepts
β 0 : Intercept (where the line crosses the Y-axis).
β 1: Slope (how steep the line is).
ϵ: Error term (residuals, the difference between actual and predicted values).


🛠️ Steps
Data Collection: Gather paired data points of X and Y.
Model Training: Estimate β 0 and β 1 using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).
Evaluation: Assess model performance with metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R 2.

Assumptions of Linear Regression 🧠📊
Linear regression assumes several conditions for accurate modeling and interpretation:

Linearity: 📈 Assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables X and the dependent variable Y.
Independence of Errors: 🔄 Assumes that the errors (residuals) ϵ are independent of each other.
Homoscedasticity: 🎯 Assumes that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables X.
Normality of Errors: 📊 Assumes that the errors ϵ are normally distributed.
No Multicollinearity: 🚫 Assumes that the independent variables X are not highly correlated with each other.

🌟 Usage
Applications: Used in fields like economics, finance, and social sciences to analyze and predict relationships between variables.



Simple Linear Regression 📈
Variables:

Independent: Only one independent variable X predicts Y.
Equation:
Models the relationship as a straight line:
Y=β 0 + β 1 ⋅ X + ϵ 

β 0 : Intercept.
β 1: Slope.
ϵ: Error term.

🔍Objective:
Predict Y based on X.

🧠📊 Assumptions:
Assumes a linear relationship between X and Y.
Error terms are independent and normally distributed.


Implementation:
Simple to implement and interpret.
Useful for exploring relationships between two variables.
Multiple Linear Regression 📊
Variables:
Independent: Involves multiple independent variables X 1,X 2 ,…,X p to predict Y.

Equation: Models the relationship with multiple predictors:

Y=β 0 + β 1 ⋅ X 1 + β 2 ⋅ X 2 + … + β p ⋅ X p + ϵ

β 0: Intercept.
β 1,β 2,…,β p: Coefficients.
ϵ: Error term.


🔍Objective:
Predict Y based on X 1,X 2,…,X p.


🧠📊 Assumptions:
Assumes a linear relationship between Y and each X i, holding others constant.
Error terms are independent and normally distributed.


Implementation:
More complex due to multiple predictors.
Allows modeling of complex relationships and interactions.


🔑Key Differences 🔄
Variables: Simple linear regression uses one X, while multiple linear regression uses X 1,X 2 , … , X p.
Complexity: Multiple linear regression is more complex to implement and interpret.
Applications: Simple linear regression for exploring simple relationships, multiple linear regression for analyzing impacts of multiple variables.
Interpretation: In simple regression, β 1 measures Y's change for a unit X change. In multiple regression, each β i affects 𝑌, holding others constant.

In summary, choose between simple and multiple linear regression based on variable count and relationship complexity you want to model.
